Some suggestions and rules: If you mention a programming language like \proglang{R}, typeset the language name with the `\proglang` macro. If you mention an \proglang{R} function `foo`, typeset the function name with standard markdown backticks. If you mention an \proglang{R} package \pkg{fooPkg}, typeset the package name with the `\pkg` macro.

Textual, *e.g.* "[@ref1] jumped over the fence" and parenthetical, *e.g.* "The fence was jumped [-@ref2]" citations may appear within the abstract.

Itemized lists are allowed in abstracts, but may be wasteful of space, which is *strictly limited*. Avoid itemized lists if possible, but gracefully. **Abstracts should not exceed one US letter (8.5 x 11 inches) page**. The page should not be numbered.
